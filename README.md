# Media and Content Strategy Working group

## About: 
This group is focused on media, content-curation and events. Coordinating material, curation, and timing of our content. We explore things like using our blog to republish content from our community, and collaboratively champion an Open Metaverse. 

## How you can get involved: 
- The group meets on the second Tuesday every month at 15:30 - 16:30 UTC (24:00 Format) 
- We track our active tickets with our [Github Projects Kanban Backlog](../../projects/1?add_cards_query=is%3Aopen)
- We organize our backlog with intent using github [Milestones](../../milestones) which makes it easier to track progress based on desired outcomes and objectives.
- We discuss our efforts using [github discussions](../../discussions). This is where we have all of our major discussions, and it is the preferred method of communicating ideas and asking questions. 
- We also have a [# OMI-Media discord channel](https://discord.gg/FkkjWGW7Nw), for general chatter, but not ideal for planning. 
- Any questions? Contact the designated working group lead(s) Shirley (LMB | LittleMissBold on Discord / @pcsmgnt on Github) or Evo (@evo on Discord and @lightlodges on github) or Jesse (mrmetaverse#0001 on discord / @mrmetaverse on github).
